# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, would like to develop a few machine learning models to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an unbalanced since the number of good loans outnumber the risky loans. Multiple techniques will be employed to determine which model(s) perform better at predicting credit risk. The dataset was first oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE. The dataset was then undersampled using ClusterCentroids. SMOTEENN algorithm was used next which combines both over- and undersampling of the data. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
